# Mocha-Messenger

This is a chat messenger that can be executed through the console (still working on GUI implementation), enabling multiple clients to send and receive messages through the server. It was quite a learning experience for me, because I originally starting writing the program not realizing that it would have to be asynchronous due to the multiple IO streams that are open and waiting for data to be sent by the users. I then had to go back and rewrite, using Thread to prevent the blocking issues, and using Object streams instead of PrintWriter and BufferedReader so that I could send serialized message objects instead of just strings. In the end I learned so much more than I expected, dabbling with multithreading and asynchrony, TCP/IP using Socket and ServerSocket, and working on a single project of this size in general.
